### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns are she/her
âš¡ I am finshing up my fifth quarter of Drexel's MLIS program
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an exercise for my Data and Digital Stewardship class at Drexel

I found this dataset pretty interesting: [nfl-play-by-play](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nfl-play-by-play) and this topic really fun: [Superhero Data Analysis](https://github.com/mars-aria/superhero_data_analysis).
